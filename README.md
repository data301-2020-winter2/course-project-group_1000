## Dataset

> *Acknowledgements: The dataset used in this project originated from [**Machine Learning with R**](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-techniques-predictive-modeling/dp/1788295862/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=machine+learning+with+r+brett&qid=1613374318&sr=8-1) - a widely-acclaimed machine learning book by Brett Lantz - as a practical example for "predicting medical expenses using linear regression" on pg. 182.*

> *The original dataset [insurance.csv] was later released in the public domain by Miri Choi as [Medical_Cost.csv] in Febuary 2018.*

The dataset ressembled demographic statistics from the US Census Bureau and simulated 1,388 individuals currently enrolled in an insurance plan. The dataset consist of the medical charges as well as 6 characteristics of each individual.


### *Attributes*
1. **Age**
   - *[Numerical Discrete]* An integer that denotes the age of each patient.
2. **Sex**
    - *[Categorical Nominal]* A String that denotes patients gender (male or female).
3. **BMI**
    - *[Numerical Continuous]* The body mass index. Indicates whether the patient is overweight or underweight in regards to his/her height.
4. **Children**
   - *[Numerical Discrete]* Provides the number of children covered by the medical insurance.
5. **Smoker**
   - *[Categorical Nominal]* Indicates whether the beneficiary smoke cigarettes.
6. **region**
    - *[Categorical Nominal]* Place of residence in the US. Divided into four regions: northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest.
7. **Medical Charges**
   - *[Numerical Continuous]* Indicates the beneficiary's annual medical expenses.

### *Purpose*
All of the attributes mentioned above provide substantial insights to how each factors may relate to one's medical expenses. Our goal of this analysis builds on top of the relationship among these attributes; with the help of data analysis tools, we seek to visualize the correlation of each attributes and medical cost. In return, we may be able to estimate one's insurance premium based on our findings.

### *Correlation Interests*
1. How does geographic regions correlates to medical charges and other personal characteristics?
2. Visualize relevant correlations between multiple quantitative variables.
3. We expect elderlies and smokers to be burdened with higher insurance premium due to higher likelyhood of health issues, but by how much? And how does the BMI affect the costs?
